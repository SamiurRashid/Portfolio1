                            <!-- It's a weird thing to do when there's a football club already at my university, but personally I like playing and dancing around with the football by myself if not with a small group of friends. While it's mostly out of the fact that the club practice times don't really match up with my day, it's probably also influenced by a lack of confidence while playing with others as well as the language barrier due to me being the only one not speaking either Chinese or Arabic during practices. -->
                            <br>
                            <!-- <br>
                            In the 2 years so far at Xiamen University Malaysia, I've completed numerous courses and learned a great deal about the electrical as well as the logical workings of many electrical components. With the help of MATLAB and Multisim, I have learned to simulate and analyze various signals, and also designed a signal noise remover/processor in Octave GUI as part of the final assignment for our course. Learning C, assembly language in MARS I have also understood the different perspectives of programming, and how assembly while more complex, allows for more focused use of specific registers while being considerate of the memory being used. I am also currently learning Verilog HDL and MCU design through the use of the Arduino IDE and ESP-32 chip. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Additionally, I spend a part of my time going on long-distance runs and occasionally participating in events, the most recent being the Kuala Lumpur Standard Charted Half Marathon which took place on the 13th of November 2022. Moreover, I also used to work as a copywriter for GadgetReview.com, writing research-based review articles on various tech products ranging from laptops, phones, thermostats and etc. Running has given me more endurance while writing articles and researching the various opinions of people has allowed me to present myself and my ideas more clearly and simultaneously learn more about recent tech.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br><br><u>Running</u><br>I started off my journey of running just for the sake of running around the end of 2018. Running at that point of time started out as something to do in order for me to lose weight, but somehow after a few months it became something I would do at least a few times a week may it be after school or early in the morning right after Fajr prayer. It became a way for me to unwind all my problems and a place where I could focus on improving myself.
                            <br><br><u>Web Development</u><br>I also learn and develop websites at times using mostly HTML, CSS and Javascript. This portfolio website is also designed from scratch using just that. However, I have also learned to use React.js and a bit of Next.js. While they would make the code a lot shorter and easier to modify. I designed this protfolio and some of the other website on my Github using just the basic 3 to make a foundation that would end up having a lot more room for improvement while also allowing me to have the motivation and knowledge to make the site myself without much trouble or having to seek guides every few minutes.
                            <br><br><u>Gaming</u><br>Although not really relevant to my Career Path, gaming is somewhat a part of who I am and something that I've probably spent a large part of my time on. I would say I started playing games around 2011 or so when my father bought me and my brother an Xbox 360. But if you were to consider playing snake on a Nokia phone gaming, well that would probably be a long while before 2011. From playing Fifa 12, Final Fantasy and many others we had accumulated quite a number of cds over the years until 2015 when the Xbox went bust. After that I began to play League of Legends around 2017 which has somehow continued on till now. Apart from that I also play Fortnite and some others with my friends from highschool on my Xbox Serie S almost everynight. And playing games with them have kept our connection with each other stronger than ever despite the fact that each of us are in different countires. -->
